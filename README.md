- 👋 Hi, I’m @pennielessarmyof1

  My philosphy when it comes to life and education is that 100% of the work and the progress acheived is entirely on the student and the amount of effort they are willing to put into their learning and their ability to view and understand the world. We are all teachers and students alike. We constantly learn from others either directly or indirectly and what we learn and experience is ultimately what shapes our view and perception of our world. As a teacher it is our duty to discover and foster an intimate relationship with our own learning. As a student it is our duty to take learning serious and to never give up on trying to discover and understand the foundations and perceptions of our world view and how we can leverage them in order to discover ourselves. It is our duty to constantly work and strive to improve by learning, adapting, trusting, and evolving the way we learn and understand the world. Teacher and student is a reciprocal relationship in which we constantly learn, adapt, and create together. It is a lifelong journey in which we play both roles at different points throughout our lives. Along this journey as an educator strive to push the boundaries of your uderstanding and be willing to listen to your students because sometimes the insights they provide although simple could create a new way of understanding and interacting with the world. As a student strive to never give up, always question what you do not understand and challenge what you beleive. Create new meaning for yourself and for others by being yourself and discovering what the world means to
- You.
