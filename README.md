- 👋 Hi, I’m @pennielessarmyof1

My philosophy on life and education is that the success of learning lies entirely in the hands of the individual—their effort, willingness to understand, and view of the world. We are all both teachers and students, constantly learning from each other in direct and indirect ways. As educators, it is our duty to cultivate a deep, personal relationship with our own learning. As students, we must commit to our education, explore foundational concepts, and use these insights to discover and understand ourselves. This lifelong journey is about constant improvement through learning, adapting, and evolving. As teachers, we should push our boundaries and be receptive to insights from our students, as these can reveal new ways of understanding. As students, we should persistently question and challenge our beliefs and strive to create new meanings through our experiences. Together and separately, let’s create new meaning not only for ourselves but for others as well by being ourselves and discovering what the world means to us.
